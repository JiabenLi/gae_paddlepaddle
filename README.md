Variational Graph Auto-Encoders in PaddlePaddle

This is a PaddlePaddle implementation of the Variational Graph Auto-Encoder model described in the paper:

T. N. Kipf, M. Welling, Variational Graph Auto-Encoders, NIPS Workshop on Bayesian Deep Learning (2016)

The code in this repo is based on or refers to https://github.com/zfjsail/gae-pytorch

# Requirements
* Python 3
* PaddlePaddle-2.1.3
* install requirements via pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
python gae/train.py

# Results
Due to the characteristics of model in the article, the results are fluctuant all the time, so we show the average results in results.txt.
